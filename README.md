# rate-card

Create a rate card component  
- Use AntD (allowed to use out of the box components and adjust them where needed; be smart and save time)  
- Ideally use typescript  
- The component should be exportable as npm and expose the props so styling is possible  
- When there are zeros behind the comma it should change to a light grey color. When there is an actual amount it should fully highlight the decimals  
- Dropdown base currency should have two values: USD and XLM  
- When the amount changes it should multiple based on the amount.  
- The amount field should have show commas when there is an amount larger than 9999  
- No negative input amount should be possible.  
  
Please let me know if something is unclear.
